# The 'old' manual way to format text with string concatenation:
print("My guitar: " + name + ", first made in " + str(year))
# A better way - using str.format():
print("My guitar: {}, first made in {}".format(name, year))
print("My guitar: {0}, first made in {1}".format(name, year))
print("My {0} was first made in {1} (that's right, {1}!)".format(name, year))
